# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

## Portfolio

- Weighted set of assets
- Wi: portion of funds in asset i
- Sum of abs(Wi) = 1.0

$$ \sum abs(w_i) = 1.0 $$

## Market Portfolio

- E.g. US: SP500, UK: FTA, Japan: TOPIX
- Cap weighted


## CAPM

- Expectation for alpha is 0

$$ r_i(t) = \beta_i * r_m(t) + \alpha_i(t) $$

                  market          + residual

## CAPM vs Active Management

- passive: buy index and hold
- active: pick stocks - overweight, underweight
- CAPM says alpha is random, and E(alpha) = 0
- Active managers belive they can predict alpha

## CAPM for portfolios

$$ r_p(t) = \sum_i w_i(\beta_i r_m(t) + \alpha_i(t)) $$

$$ \beta_p = \sum_i w_i\beta_i$$

CAPM

$$ r_p(t) = \beta_pr_m(t) + \alpha_p(t) $$

Active portfolio

$$ r_p(t) = \beta_pr_m(t) + \sum w_i\alpha_i(t) $$

## Implications of CAPM

$$ r_i(t) = \beta_i * r_m(t) + \alpha_i(t) $$

- Expected value of 

  $$ \alpha  = 0 $$

- Only way to beat market is choose beta
- Choose high beta in up markets
- Choose low beta in downlo markets
- Efficient markets hypothesis (EMH) says you can't predict the market

CAPM says you can't beat market.

## Arbitrage Pricing Theory

- Stephen Ross 1976 

$$ r_i(t) = \beta_i * r_m(t) + \alpha_i(t) $$

CAPM = Ocean

break beta into different sectors

$$ \beta_i f r_f + \beta_i t r_t + .... $$
