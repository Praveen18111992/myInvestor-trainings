# What is a company worth

- true value of the company
- intrinsic value - dividend payout
- book value - assets on the book
- market cap - shares outstanding


PV = present value
FV = future value
IR - Interest rate

PV = FV / (1+IR)^i


1% = 1.00 / (1+0.01) = $0.99

5% = 1.00 / (1+0.05) = $0.95


## Intrinsic value

Discount rate is higher if more risky

Interest Rate and Discount Rate are terms that refer to essentially the same quantity, but are used to distinguish two slightly different use cases:
- Interest Rate is used with a given Present Value, to figure out what the Future Value would be.
- Discount Rate is used when we have a known or desired Future Value, and want to compute the corresponding Present Value.

For instance, in this case we want to sum up all future dividends - equal to a constant ($1 or FV) every year.

Intrinsic value  = FV / DR

## Book value
- Total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities.


## Market capitalization
market cap = #shares * price
