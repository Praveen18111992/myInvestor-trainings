# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

## Portfolio

- Weighted set of assets
- Wi: portion of funds in asset i
- Sum of abs(Wi) = 1.0

$$ \sum abs(w_i) = 1.0 $$

## Market Portfolio

- E.g. US: SP500, UK: FTA, Japan: TOPIX
- Cap weighted


## CAPM

- Expectation for alpha is 0

$$ r_i(t) = \beta_i * r_m(t) + \alpha_i(t) $$

                  market          + residual

## CAPM vs Active Management

- passive: buy index and hold
- active: pick stocks - overweight, underweight, 

- CAPM says alpha is random, and E(alpha) = 0
- Active managers belive they can predict alpha

## CAPM for portfolios
$$ r_p(t) = \sum_i w_i(\beta_i r_m(t) + \alpha_i(t)) $$
