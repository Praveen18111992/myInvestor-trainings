# How machine learning is used at a hedge fund

## The ML problem

x -> model -> y

x = observation, e.g. PE ratio, Bollingers Band
y = prediction - single dimension

Data -> ML -> model

## Supervised regression learning

* regression - numerical prediction
* supervised - provide example x, y
* learning - train with data

* Linear regression (parametric)
* k nearest neighbor (knn) (instance based)
* decision trees
* decision forests

## Robot navigation example

## How it works with stock data

Historical data  (X is multi-dimensional) -> Historical price (Y)

## Example at a fintech company

Data

* select x1, x2, x3,.... predictive factors
* select Y

* time period, stock universe

* train - knn, linear regression....
* predict

## ML tool in use

## Problems with regression

* noisy and uncertain
* challenging to estimate confidence
* holding time, allocation

-> Policy learning RL

## Problem we will focus on
