# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

## Portfolio
- Weighted set of assets
- Wi: portion of funds in asset i
- Sum of abs(Wi) = 1.0

## Market Portfolio
- E.g. US: SP500, UK: FTA, Japan: TOPIX
- Cap weighted


## CAPM
- Expectation for alpha is 0

ri(t) = beta i * rm(t) + alpha i (t)
      = market         + residual
      
      
## CAPM vs Active Management
- passive: buy index and hold
- active: pick stocks - overweight, underweight, 

- CAPM says alpha is random, and E(alpha) = 0
- Active managers belive they can predict alpha
